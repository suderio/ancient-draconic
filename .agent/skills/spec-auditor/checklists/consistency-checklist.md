# Consistency Checklist

## Contract Integrity

1. Every domain file references canonical interfaces from `.agent/reference/interfaces.md`.
2. No file redefines interface names with conflicting semantics.
3. Error categories align with taxonomy in `.agent/reference/interfaces.md`.

## Boundary Integrity

1. `architecture.md` enforces dependency direction and orchestrator orchestration boundaries.
2. `code.md` implementation rules do not contradict `architecture.md`.
3. Adapter-specific concerns stay outside domain contracts.

## Behavior Integrity

1. `resource-repo.md` path safety rules reject traversal.
2. `secrets.md` non-disclosure rules are strict and enforceable.

## CLI and UX Integrity

1. `cli.md` command semantics map to orchestrator use cases.
2. Validation and destructive-operation safeguards are explicit.
3. Structured output expectations are stable.

## Routing and Skill Integrity

1. `AGENTS.md` request matrix remains canonical and `.agent/skills/spec-router/SKILL.md` supplemental routing rules do not contradict it.
2. Skill order and trigger guidance are consistent between `AGENTS.md` and each `.agent/skills/*/SKILL.md`.
3. All skill references point to existing files and use stable paths.

## Quality Coverage Integrity

1. `quality.md` includes required scenario coverage for all high-risk behaviors.
2. Every new normative rule has a corresponding test expectation.
3. Security-sensitive scenarios include negative tests.
4. Verification guidance remains risk-based and proportional to change impact.

## File Organization Integrity

1. Files are scoped by single dominant responsibility.
2. Split triggers are documented and applied consistently.
3. No unnecessary placeholder or duplicate files exist.
4. Completion checklist requirements are achievable from the documented workflows.

## Spec Quality Integrity

1. Rules are efficient and do not duplicate canonical guidance unnecessarily.
2. Normative language is assertive and uses `MUST`/`SHOULD`/`MAY` consistently.
3. Requirements are objective, observable, and testable.
4. Redundant rules are consolidated to one canonical source with cross-references.
