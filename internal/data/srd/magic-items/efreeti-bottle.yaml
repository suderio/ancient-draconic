  - Wondrous item, very rare
  - This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.
  - The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.
  - '| d100 | Effect |'
  - '|---|---|'
  - '| 01-10 | The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |'
  - '| 11-90 | The efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can''t be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |'
  - '| 91-100 | The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic. |'
