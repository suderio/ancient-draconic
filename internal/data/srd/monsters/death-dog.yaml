Every 24 hours that elapse, the creature must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0.'

desc: A death dog is an ugly two-headed hound that roams plains, and deserts. Hate burns in a death dog’s heart, and a taste for humanoid flesh drives it to attack travelers and explorers. Death dog saliva carries a foul disease that causes a victim’s flesh to slowly rot off the bone.
