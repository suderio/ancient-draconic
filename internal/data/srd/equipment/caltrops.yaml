  - As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side.
  - Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage.
  - Taking this damage reduces the creature's walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point.
  - A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.
