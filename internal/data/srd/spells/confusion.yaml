desc:
  - This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.
  - An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.
  - '| d10 | Behavior |'
  - '|---|---|'
  - '| 1 | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn''t take an action this turn. |'
  - '| 2-6 | The creature doesn''t move or take actions this turn. |'
  - '| 7-8 | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn. |'
  - '| 9-10 | The creature can act and move normally. |'
  - At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.
