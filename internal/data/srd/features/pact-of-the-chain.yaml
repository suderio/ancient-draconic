desc:
  - You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.
  - 'When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.'
  - Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.
  - Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with imps and quasits tied to the Fiend.
