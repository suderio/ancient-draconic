desc:
  - Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze) or legendary (iron)
  - You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker. They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.
  - Four types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly.
  - '| d100 | Horn Type | Berserkers Summoned | Requirement |'
  - '|---|---|---|---|'
  - '| 01-40 | Silver | 2d4 + 2 | None |'
  - '| 41-75 | Brass | 3d4 + 3 | Proficiency with all simple weapons |'
  - '| 76-90 | Bronze | 4d4 + 4 | Proficiency with all medium armor |'
  - '| 91-00 | Iron | 5d4 + 5 | Proficiency with all martial weapons |'
  - If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.
