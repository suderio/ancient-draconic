desc:
  - This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.
  - The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet.
  - It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.
