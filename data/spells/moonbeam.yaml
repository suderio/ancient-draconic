desc:
  - A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.
  - When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  - A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.
  - On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.
duration: Up to 1 minute
higher_level:
  - When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1dl0 for each slot level above 2nd.
