  - Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.
  - Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.
  - If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
  - At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.
